Cache
-----

Cache is a set of key-value pairs that can be used to instantly read/write with min. time complexity.
Cache has limited storage so certain elements are needed to evict from the cache depending on 
the eviction policy.

Eviction policies
-----------------
1) Random - Randomly get/put elements from cache with no priority.
2) FIFO - Have a queue of keys, delete the first element from the queue when gets full.
3) LRU - Have doubly linked list. When put/get element from cache, set them to the highest priority.
